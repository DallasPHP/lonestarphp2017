            <p>Thanks to the generous support of our sponsors year after year we're able to present this conference at minimal cost to our attendees, opening up attendance to many who could not normally  justify the cost of similar events. We couldn't do it without their support and we hope that this year you'll help us share this experience with the community. With the amazing feedback we receive each year from our attendees and sponsors we continue to improve our event to keep our place as the best php community conference around.</p>
            <p>In 2016, Lone Star PHP looks to build on its previous success. If you would like to be a part of making 2016 the best event yet. <a href="/assets/docs/LoneStarPHP_2016_Sponsorship_Prospectus.pdf">View the 2016 sponsor prospectus</a>.</p>
