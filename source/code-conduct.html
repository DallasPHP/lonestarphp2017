        <h3>Short Version</h3>
        <p>Lone Star PHP prides itself on being one of the best community-run conference experiences. Our conference is open to anyone and everyone with a love of PHP and Technology, regardless of gender, sexual orientation, disability, physical appearance, body size, race, religion, or preference for Star Wars over Star Trek. To ensure everyone has an amazing experience, we, the conference organizers, will not tolerate any harassment or sexually charged language directed at any of our attendees. Though we have yet to have any incidents, the organizers will deal with each situation on a case-by-case basis and reserve the right to sanction or expel offenders from the conference without refund.</p>

        <h3>Long Version</h3>
        <p>Though each situation will be dealt with individually, this document serves as a public notice as to the criteria the organizers will use to evaluate each incident:</p>

        <p>Harassment includes offensive verbal comments related to gender, sexual orientation, disability, physical appearance, body size, race, religion, sexual images in public spaces, deliberate intimidation, stalking, following, harassing photography or recording, sustained disruption of talks or other events, inappropriate physical contact, and unwelcome sexual attention.</p>

        <p>Participants asked to stop any harassing behavior are expected to comply immediately.</p>

        <p>Sponsors are also subject to the anti-harassment policy. In particular, sponsors should not use sexualized images, activities, or other material. Booth staff (including volunteers) should not use sexualized clothing/uniforms/costumes, or otherwise create a sexualized environment.</p>

        <p>If a participant (sponsored or otherwise) engages in harassing behavior, the conference organizers may take any action they deem appropriate, including warning the offender or expulsion from the conference with no refund.</p>

        <p>If you are being harassed, notice that someone else is being harassed, or have any other concerns, please contact a member of conference staff immediately. Conference staff can be identified by their unique badges.</p>

        <p>Conference staff will be happy to help participants contact hotel/venue security or local law enforcement, provide escorts, or otherwise assist those experiencing harassment to feel safe for the duration of the conference. We value your attendance.</p>

        <p>We expect participants to follow these rules at conference and workshop venues and conference-related social events.</p>
